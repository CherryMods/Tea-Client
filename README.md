# Tea Client (K-Client v3)

This is my personal fork of Wurst, with minor features and improvements.

Some stuff it adds:

- A feature to convert certain `:emojicodes:` to emojis in chat
- Disable the top left corner logo, even when running outdated versions
- Command to quickly open a user's NameMC profile
- Chat spambot with placeholders strings like the current time or a random number/username
- Option to make sneaking temporarily disable the Glide cheat
- More capes for people I know (Don't worry, Wurst capes still show up too)

There were some more features like KillAura CPS randomization and "legit" SafeWalk, but
over time, Wurst implemented them too, and I replaced mine with theirs for smoother updates.

## ⚠ IMPORTANT ⚠

If you have any suggestions for this repo that aren't specifically related to Tea, (for example, you made a new hack)
please go contribute to [the original repo](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7) instead!

## Setup (for contributors)

To work on the project, you need to set it up the exactly the same way as Wurst.
You can find instructions in [the README](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7)!
