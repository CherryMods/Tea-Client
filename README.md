# Tea Client (K-Client v3)

This is my personal fork of Wurst, with minor features and improvements.

## ⚠ IMPORTANT ⚠

If you have any suggestions for this repo that aren't related to K-specific features, (for example, you made a new hack)
please go contribute to [the original repo](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7) instead!

## Setup (for contributors)

To work on the project, you need to set it up the exactly the same way as Wurst.
You can find instructions in [the README file](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7)!

This project runs on Java 17. Make sure you have a JDK for Java 17 before reporting build errors!

## Note about Pull Requests

If you are contributing multiple unrelated features, please create a separate pull request for each feature.
Squeezing everything into one giant pull request makes it very difficult for us to add your features,
as we have to test, validate and add them one by one.

Thank you for your understanding - and thanks again for taking the time to contribute!!
