# Tea Client (K-Client v3)

This is my personal fork of Wurst, with minor features and improvements.

## ⚠ IMPORTANT ⚠

If you have any suggestions for this repo that aren't related to tea-specific features, (for example, you made a new hack)
please go contribute to [the original repo](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7) instead!

## Setup (for contributors)

To work on the project, you need to set it up the exactly the same way as Wurst.
You can find instructions in [the README file](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7)!
